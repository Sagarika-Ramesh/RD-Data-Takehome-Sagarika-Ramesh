Deep Learning Classifier used for the classification:
1)VGG model - transfer learning(for feature extraction)
2)CNN model
3)VGGFace - transfer learning(for feature extraction)
All these models are train on fewer epochs and small dataset. The performance of these models can be increased with fine tuning the model (by adding more layers, Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization..etc )
