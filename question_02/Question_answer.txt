2. You are given a classifier that reports high accuracy on the validation set:
a. Would you be happy with these results or would you like to do more analysis.
Answer: I would do more analysis to ensure that it is not biased or overfitting.
b. If so, what type of analysis would you perform?
Answer: I would check for overfitting,I would perform K fold cross validation.
Check for imbalanced data or biased data. 
I will make sure regularization and hyperparameter tuning is performed to mitigate overfitting, 
I will use suitable metric which is suitable for imbalanced data like F1-Score, confusion metric, AUROC Score.
