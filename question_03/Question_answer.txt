3. Write a simple (supervised) deep classifier to train and test using the dataset collected in Q1.
a. How will you divide your dataset into training and test sets.
Answer: I will split my dataset into 80% train and  20% validation. I have a seperate test dataset(unseen).

b. What data-augmentation techniques will to use for out-of-distribution (unseen) images?
Answer:I have randomly flip the image horizontally. I can further improve this augumentation by changing contrast, zoom, and other augmentation techniques.

c. Please test accuracy on the attached, rd_test_dataset zipped face images, and save the output to a .csv file.

Accuracy on the unseen dataset is found to be around 60 by the 3 models. 
I am trying to increase the accuracy by hyperparameter tuning and increasing the epochs.
